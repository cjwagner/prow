# Run Prow integration tests

## Run everything

This script would [setup](#setup) the environment, [run](#run-test) all the available integration tests, and then [cleans up](#cleanup) everything.

```bash
./prow/test/integration/integration-test.sh
```

## Setup

* [Setup a local registry](setup-local-registry.sh).
* Compile prow components, generate images, and push them to the registry.
* [Create a local cluster](setup-cluster.sh) using [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/).
* Wait for prow components to be ready.

```bash
./prow/test/integration/integration-test.sh setup
```

## Run test

After prow is installed on top of the local cluster, run the integration tests under [test](test) directory

Optional parameters:

* [--test_filter](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/command-line-reference.html#flag--test_filter) - Specifies a filter to forward to the test framework.
* [--cache_test_results](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/command-line-reference.html#flag--cache_test_results) - Whether to cache test results.

```bash
./prow/test/integration/integration-test.sh run [--test_filter=TestHook] [--cache_test_results=no]
```

## Cleanup

Delete the local cluster and the local registry.

```bash
./prow/test/integration/integration-test.sh teardown
```

# Add new integration tests

## Add new components

(Assume the component to be added is named `most-awesome-component`)

* Add `most-awesome-component` at [`testimage-push`](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/f9fb6d28ebbcf77dc0b99d741b8df5f5d85c739e/prow/BUILD.bazel#L66) target, so that the component is pushed to `localhost:5000` registry
* Deploy `most-awesome-component` during integration test https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/f9fb6d28ebbcf77dc0b99d741b8df5f5d85c739e/prow/test/integration/setup-cluster.sh#L33, and cleanup the component after integration test https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/f9fb6d28ebbcf77dc0b99d741b8df5f5d85c739e/prow/test/integration/cleanup.sh#L23
* Add `most-awesome-component` deployment yaml at https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/prow/test/integration/prow/cluster, so that the deployment works. Modifications involve:
  * `most-awesome-component_service.yaml` and `most-awesome-component_rbac.yaml` can be symlinks from https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/config/prow/cluster.
  * `most-awesome-component_deployment.yaml` will at least requires changing image registry to `localhost:5000` like https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/f9fb6d28ebbcf77dc0b99d741b8df5f5d85c739e/prow/test/integration/prow/cluster/hook_deployment.yaml#L41.
  * [If using github client] `github-endpoint` should be changed to `fakeghserver`, which was from https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/prow/test/integration/fakeghserver.
* [If using github client] Existing fake github server only implemented partial github APIs, will need to add APIs that `most-awesome-component` uses at https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/prow/test/integration/fakeghserver

## Add new tests

Tests are implemented in Go, located at [`test`](./test) directory.

* [If this is a new component] Create a file called `most-awesome-component_test.go`
* Add test in `most-awesome-component_test.go`
